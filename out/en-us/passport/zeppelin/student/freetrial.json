Each subsequent day you access the Pearson content from the Learning Management System, you're prompted to enter an access code, purchase online access, or continue without paying until the temporary access period expires.</p>\n<p>We've compiled a list of our more frequently asked questions about purchasing an online subscription. Here's what students are asking:            </p>\n            <h2>Can I extend my temporary access period?</h2>\n<p>Temporary access cannot be extended. When your temp access period ends, you will be prompted to either enter a prepaid product access code purchased from the campus bookstore or pay by credit card or PayPal the next time you enter your course. </p>\n            <p>Keep in mind, the day you receive the course invitation link from your instructor may not be the course start date. Some students choose to try temp access on the first day of class; however, joining your instructor's course as soon as you receive your Course Invite link gives you time to get settled in and explore.</p>\n    <h2>My temporary access period expired, what now?</h2>\n<p>When your temporary access period expires, you will see a prompt to either enter an access code or purchase online access the next time you select a course title from the <strong>My</strong> <strong>Courses</strong> page. Once you have entered a valid access code or completed payment, you will have full access to course materials.</p>\n<h2>How long can I use this product for? </h2>\n<p>Varied by product, the time period is listed in your product's purchase options. You will have access to your digital course materials for the time period specified from the point of purchase.</p>"
