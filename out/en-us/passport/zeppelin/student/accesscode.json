Here's what students are asking:</p>\r\n    <h2>Where do I find my access code?</h2>\r\n    <p>Your access code is found either in the access code card that you purchased at your school’s  bookstore or in the access code card that you purchased online. Alternatively, if you want to buy instant access by clicking <strong>Purchase Now</strong>, you will not need an access code.</p>\r\n    <h2>What is included on the access code (tests, homework, flashcards, etc.)? </h2>\r\n    <p>Whether you purchase an access code at your school bookstore or purchase  immediate access using a credit card or PayPal account, you receive access to everything  your Pearson digital text materials have to offer! Your complete course text, videos, interactives, quizzing, highlight and  notetaking functionality, an assignment calendar, and performance dashboard -- it’s all  yours!</p>\r\n    <h2>May I share this access code with one other person in my class? </h2>\r\n    <p>No. Access codes are unique and only redeemable once.</p>\r\n    <h2>How long can I use this product for? </h2>\r\n    <p>Varied by product, the time period is listed in your product’s purchase options. You will have access to your digital course materials for the time period specified from the point of purchase.</p>"
