  "content": "<p>Temporary access cannot be extended. When your temporary access period ends, you are prompted to either enter a prepaid product access code purchased from the campus bookstore or pay by credit card or PayPal the next time you access your course materials.</p>\r\n            <p>Keep in mind, the day you receive the invitation link from your instructor might not be the course start date. Some students choose to try the temporary access on the first day of class; however, getting your materials as soon as you recieve your invitation link gives you time to get settled in and explore.</p>"
