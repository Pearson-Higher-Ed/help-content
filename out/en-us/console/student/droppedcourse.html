  <li>If you were accidentally dropped from your course, contact your instructor. They can reactivate your enrollment.</li>
<li>If you were dropped because you transferred to another section of a course OR signed up for the wrong section/instructor, contact your new instructor. In the event that your new course is using the same title, your instructor can send you the course invitation link and you can enroll and access your new course without having to purchase another subscription or redeem an access code a second time.</li>
