After your temporary access period ends, when you try to access your course materials, you are prompted to do any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purchase and enter a prepaid product access code purchased from the campus bookstore</li>
                <li>Pay by credit card (or PayPal)</li>
            </ul> 
            <p><b>Note</b>: The day you receive the invitation link from your instructor might not be the actual course start date. </p>
            <p><b>Tip</b>: Getting your course materials as soon as you receive your invitation link gives you time to get settled in and explore.</p></div></div>
