This saves you time, and you only have one username and password to remember.</p>\r\n        <p>To get your account information, select <strong>Forgot your username or password</strong> and follow the instructions. If you have an account, you'll get an email with your username and a link to reset your password. (If you're linking accounts from a Learning Management  System, the Reset Password page opens in a new window or tab. After you reset your password, close both windows or tabs and return to your Learning Management  System to continue.)</p>\r\n        <p>Your username and password are case-sensitive.</p>"
