Use an existing account to save time and only have one username and password to remember.</p>\r\n        <p>Instead of creating a new account, try these tips for resolving common issues with signing in:</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Username:</strong> Your username might be your email address and differ from your school or institution username. <em>Username</em> is called <em>login name</em> on some Pearson websites.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Password:</strong> Your password is case-sensitive and has at least one letter, one number, and eight characters. Select <strong>SHOW</strong> to see your password as you enter it.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Get username and reset password:</strong> Select <strong>Forgot username or password</strong> to get an email with your username and a link to reset your password. If you have more than one Pearson account associated with your email address, the email has multiple usernames and reset password links.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Incorrect username or password or account locked: </strong>If a message says your username or password is incorrect and you think you entered them correctly or a message says your account is locked, select <strong>Forgot username or password</strong>.
