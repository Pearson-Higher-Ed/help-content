        <ul>
            <li>You can click <strong>Link Accounts</strong> at the bottom of the page if you remember your Pearson account. You&apos;ll return to the&#xA0;Link Accounts page where you enter your username and password.</li>
            <li>If you enter an email address associated with an existing account, a message appears asking you to sign in, look up your account information, or continue creating the new account. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We recommend you use an existing account to get access to REVEL, so you don&apos;t have to enter your personal information again and only have one username and password to remember.</p></div></div>
