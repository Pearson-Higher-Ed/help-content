If you manually change the clock or switch the time zone without immediately making sure the clock—automatically or manually—matches the time zone, the error appears.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Switch to the correct time zone, if applicable. Make sure the date and time are correct for your time zone. If your clock is set manually—not from a network or Internet server, make sure it comes close to the time according to the World Clock. (You can search for the World Clock on the Internet.)</p>"
