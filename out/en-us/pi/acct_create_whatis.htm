To access REVEL from <span>Blackboard</span>, you only need to link your Pearson and <span>Blackboard</span> accounts once. You can also use your new Pearson account to register for access to other Pearson courses outside of <span>Blackboard</span>. When you sign in with your account during registration, your new course access gets added to your existing account. For example, if you use your account to register for a MyLab product, you can use the same account to register for a Modified Mastering product.</p>
        <p>Using one Pearson account saves you time! You don&apos;t have to enter your personal information again and only have one username and password to remember.</p></div></div>
