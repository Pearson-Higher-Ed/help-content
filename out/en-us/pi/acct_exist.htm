We recommend you use an existing account instead of creating a new one. This saves you time, and you only have one username and password to remember.</p>
        <p>To get your account information, select <strong>Forgot your username or password</strong> and follow the instructions. If you have an account, you&apos;ll get an email with your username and a link to reset your password. (If you&apos;re linking accounts from a Learning Management  System, the Reset Password page opens in a new window or tab. After you reset your password, close both windows or tabs and return to your Learning Management  System to continue.)</p>
