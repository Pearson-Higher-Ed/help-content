We recommend you use an existing account instead of creating a new one. This saves you time, and you only have one username and password to remember.</p>
        <p>To get your account information, click<strong> Forgot your username or password</strong> and follow the instructions. If you have an account, you&apos;ll get an email with your username and a link to reset your password. (<strong>Tip:</strong> The Reset Password page opens in a separate window or tab from where you started. After you reset your password, close both windows or tabs and return to Blackboard. Navigate to the <strong>Go to REVEL</strong> link to continue.)</p>
        <p>Your username and password are case-sensitive.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure you only link one account to your Pearson account. Otherwise, there might be a problem with grade return from Pearson&#xA0;REVEL&#xA0;to <span>Blackboard</span>.</p></div></div>
