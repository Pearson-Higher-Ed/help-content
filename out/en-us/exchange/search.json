  "content": "<p>You can search for Pearson content using specific search terms such as a title, description, ISBN, or author name. You can broaden your search using other keywords such as <strong>introduction</strong> or <strong>psychology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <h2>Search types</h2>\r\n        <p>Your search term can contain a keyword or phrase.</p>\r\n        <h3>Keyword</h3>\r\n        <p>A keyword is a single word without quotes. For example, <strong>psychology</strong> returns all results with that keyword such as <strong>Beginning Psychology</strong> and <strong>Introduction to Psychology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <h3>Phrase</h3>\r\n        <p>A phrase is a group of words enclosed with double quotes. For example, <strong>&quot;beginning psychology&quot;</strong> only returns results containing the entire phrase, such as <strong>Beginning Psychology for Social Workers</strong>, but not <strong>Introduction to Psychology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>If you search for a phrase without double quotes, each word in the search terms is considered a separate keyword. For example, <strong>beginning psychology</strong> returns items including <strong>beginning</strong> or <strong>psychology</strong>, such as <strong>Beginning Algebra</strong> and <strong>Applied Psychology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <h2>Wildcard searches with partial keywords</h2>\r\n        <p>You can search with a wildcard (<strong>*</strong> or <strong>?</strong>) representing one or more characters.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use a wildcard  as the first character of a search.</p>\r\n        <h3>Single-character wildcard</h3>\r\n        <p>For a single-character wildcard, enter a question mark (<strong>?</strong>). For example, <strong>te?t</strong> returns <strong>test</strong> or <strong>text</strong>.</p>\r\n        <h3>Multiple-character wildcard</h3>\r\n        <p>For a multiple-character wildcard, enter an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>). For example, <strong>test*</strong> returns <strong>test</strong>, <strong>tests</strong>, or <strong>tester</strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>You can also use a wildcard in the middle of a search term. For example: <strong>te*t</strong></p>\r\n        <h2>Combine or exclude keywords (OR, AND, NOT)</h2>\r\n        <p>You can use <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>AND</strong>, or <strong>NOT</strong> (also called Boolean operators) to broaden or narrow your search. </p>\r\n        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always enter Boolean operators in all uppercase letters.</p>\r\n        <h3>OR</h3>\r\n        <p>If you use <strong>OR</strong> in a search term, your results include either keyword. If there is no Boolean operator between two search terms, <strong>OR</strong> is the default. For example, <strong>beginning OR psychology</strong>and <strong>beginning psychology</strong> return <strong>Beginning Psychology</strong> and <strong>Beginning Sociology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>You can also use the symbolic equivalent of <strong>OR</strong>, which is <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong></p>\r\n        <h3>AND</h3>\r\n        <p>If you use <strong>AND</strong> in a search term, your results only include items with both keywords. For example,  <strong>beginning AND psychology</strong> returns <strong>Beginning Psychology</strong> and <strong>Beginning Psychology for Social Workers</strong> but not<strong> Beginning Sociology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>You can also use the symbolic equivalent of <strong>AND</strong>, which is <strong>||</strong></p>\r\n        <h3>NOT</h3>\r\n        <p>If you use <strong>NOT</strong> in a search term, your results exclude the keyword. For example, <strong>psychology NOT beginning</strong> returns  <strong>Introduction to Psychology</strong> and <strong>Applied Psychology</strong> but not <strong>Beginning Psychology</strong>.</p>\r\n        <p>You can also use the symbolic equivalent of <strong>NOT</strong>, which is <strong>!</strong></p>"
