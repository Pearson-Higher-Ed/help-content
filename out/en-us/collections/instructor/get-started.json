Select Your Delivery Method</h2>\r\n        <p>Choose whether you want to deliver your Collection to students as a printed book or give them digital access. You can also do both.</p>\r\n        <h2>2. Choose Your Content</h2>\r\n        <p>Contact Sales to build a Collection for you or Do-it-yourself with pre-curated Collections.</p>\r\n        <p>You can begin with Collection curated by subject matter experts or do it yourself from scratch to give your students the exact mix of content you want to cover. </p>\r\n        <p>Select course materials from your favorite Pearson\r\n\t\tdigital books, cases, readings, and primary sources. You can also upload content you've created and own. </p>\r\n        <h2>3. Publish Your Collection</h2>\r\n        <p>After you're done assembling your Collection, it's time to get it into your students' hands. Publish your project, and we'll take it from there. For print Collections, you will receive an ISBN immediately upon publication so that you can place the order with your bookstore. Printed collections are manufactured on demand and shipped to your bookstore within 3 weeks of placing the order.</p>\r\n        <p>Digital collections will be ready for student registration and use within a few days. We'll notify you and provide a web link that takes students directly to your Collection.</p>"
