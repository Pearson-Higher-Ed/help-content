        <p>Contact Sales to build a Collection for you or Do-it-yourself with pre-curated Collections.</p>

        <p>Select course materials from your favorite Pearson

        <h2>3. Publish Your Collection</h2>
        <p>After you&apos;re done assembling your Collection, it&apos;s time to get it into your students&apos; hands. Publish your project, and we&apos;ll take it from there.
