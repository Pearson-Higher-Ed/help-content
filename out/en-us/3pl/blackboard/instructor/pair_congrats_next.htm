You go to the Pearson REVEL&#xA0;Confirmation page in <span>Blackboard</span> where you choose the folder location of your REVEL&#xA0;link. You can then access REVEL tools from your <span>Blackboard</span> course.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you close the browser or tab and don&apos;t select <strong>Return to Course</strong>, your REVEL content is not added to your <span>Blackboard</span> course. You&apos;ll need to start the process again by adding REVEL to the commercial content in your <span>Blackboard</span> course. For instructions, see the REVEL&#xA0;help for <span>Blackboard</span>. </p></div></div>
