        <p>For example, the default time zone for computers with the Windows operating system is Pacific Time. If you manually change the clock or switch the time zone without immediately making sure the clock&#x2014;automatically or manually&#x2014;matches the time zone, the error appears.</p>
        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong>&#xA0;Switch to the correct time zone, if applicable. Make sure the date and time are correct for your time zone. If your clock is set manually&#x2014;not from a network or Internet server, make sure it comes close to the time according to the World Clock.
