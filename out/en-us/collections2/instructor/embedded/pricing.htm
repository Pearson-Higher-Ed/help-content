In general, the cost is the Collection&apos;s base price plus a per page cost for uploaded content over 50 pages.</p>
        <p>The base price is $8 (for any Collection containing only original uploaded material) or $15 (for any Collection with a mix of Pearson content and uploaded material). </p>
        <p>The per page cost is $0 for the first fifty pages of uploaded content. For example, a 50 page custom book (created from a print Collection) containing all original uploaded content costs $8. The same book with Pearson content replacing one chapter costs $15.</p>
        <p>The cost for every page of uploaded material over 50 in the printed book is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cents (black and white pages)</li>
            <li>6 cents (color pages)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use a mix of color and black and white pages, you are charged 6 cents for every page in the book over 50 pages.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>A 300 page book (Collection) of original uploaded black and white content costs: $8 + (250 x 0.02) = $13.</li>
            <li>A 300 page book of original uploaded color content costs: $8 + (250 x 0.06) = $23.</li>
            <li>A 300 page book of original uploaded content, where some chapters are black and white and some are color costs:  $8 + (250 x 0.06) = $23.</li>
            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded black and white content costs: $15 + (250 x 0.02) = $20.</li>
            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded color content costs $15 + (250 x 0.06) = $30.</li>
            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded content, where some chapters are black and white and some are color costs:  $15 + (250 x 0.06) = $30.</li>
