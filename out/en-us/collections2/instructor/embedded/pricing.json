The base price is $8 (for any Collection containing only original uploaded material) or $15 (for any Collection with a mix of Pearson content and uploaded material). The per page cost is $0 for the first fifty pages of uploaded content. For example, a 50 page custom book containing all original uploaded content costs $8. The same book with Pearson content replacing one chapter costs $15. The cost for every page of uploaded material over 50 in the printed book is:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>2 cents (black and white pages)</li>\r\n            <li>6 cents (color pages)</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use a mix of color and black and white pages, you are charged 6 cents for every page in the book over 50 pages.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Examples</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book (Collection) of original uploaded black and white content costs: $8 + (250 x 0.02) = $13.</li>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book of original uploaded color content costs: $8 + (250 x 0.06) = $23.</li>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book of original uploaded content, where some chapters are black and white and some are color costs:  $8 + (250 x 0.06) = $23.</li>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded black and white content costs: $15 + (250 x 0.02) = $20.</li>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded color content costs $15 + (250 x 0.06) = $30.</li>\r\n            <li>A 300 page book of Pearson and uploaded content, where some chapters are black and white and some are color costs:  $15 + (250 x 0.06) = $30.</li>\r\n        </ul>"
