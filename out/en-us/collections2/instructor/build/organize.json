This works best when you need to move the content a short distance, for example transposing two items. </li>\r\n            <li>Select <strong>Option</strong> (the button with three dots) and then one of the move selections, for example, <strong>Move to Top</strong> or <strong>Move to Bottom</strong>.</li>\r\n            <li>If you've grouped content into parts, select <strong>Option</strong>, and then select one of the Move to options. For example, move an item into another part, select <strong>Move to another part</strong> and then select the part for the selected item.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>You can group content together by creating a part and moving content into it. The part is not a container. It is a logical divider for you to organize content.</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Place the mouse pointer over the divider that separates two items on the screen. The text <strong>Create a Part</strong> appears.</li>\r\n            <li>Select <strong>Create a Part</strong>. The new part appears for you to rename and move content into.</li>\r\n        </ol>"
