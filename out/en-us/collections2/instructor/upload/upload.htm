        <p>If you don&apos;t hold the copyright, Pearson can help you acquire it for a Collection. When this is done, Pearson tries to acquire rights for the submitted content. </p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Pearson Collections requires a class of 100 students in order to upload content.</p>
