        <ul>
            <li>Select the items to move and drag and drop them to a new location. This works best when you need to move the content a short distance, for example transposing two items. </li>
            <li>Select <strong>Option</strong> (the button with three dots) and then one of the move selections, for example, <strong>Move to Top</strong> or <strong>Move to Bottom</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you&apos;ve grouped content into parts, select <strong>Option</strong>, and then select one of the Move to options. For example, move an item into another part, select <strong>Move to another part</strong> and then select the part for the selected item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can group content together by creating a part and moving content into it. The part is not a container. It is a logical divider for you to organize content.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the mouse pointer over the divider that separates two items on the screen. The text <strong>Create a Part</strong> appears.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Create a Part</strong>. The new part appears for you to rename and move content into.</li>
        </ol></div></div>
