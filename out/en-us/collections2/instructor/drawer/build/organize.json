Use this method to move content a short distance, for example transposing two items. </li>\r\n            <li>Select <strong>Option</strong> (the button with three dots) and then one of the Move commands. Use <strong>Move to Position</strong> to move an item to a specific location. For example, to move a chapter to position 5, increment the value in the field to 5. If you've grouped content into parts, Use <strong>Move to another part</strong> to move content from one part to another.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>You can group content together by creating a part and moving content into it. The part is not a container. It is a logical divider for you to organize content.</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Place the mouse pointer over the divider that separates two items on the screen. The text <strong>Create a Part</strong> appears.</li>\r\n            <li>Select <strong>Create a Part</strong>. The new part appears for you to rename and move content into.</li>\r\n        </ol>"
