        <p>Collections you create always have one of the following statuses:</p>
        <p><strong>In progress</strong>: The Collection is under development; you can edit an in-progress Collection until you are ready to publish it.</p>
        <p><strong>Submitted</strong>: The Collection has been submitted for publication.</p>
        <p><strong>No Longer Available</strong>: Your Collection includes content that is out-of-print or the rights to the content are no longer owned by Pearson. As a result, the Collection cannot be printed or ordered with the current ISBN.</p>
        <p>To correct this, you can copy the Collection with the content that is still available and submit it to obtain a new ISBN. </p></div></div>
