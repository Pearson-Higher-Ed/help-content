You can share it after you initially create it, after you make a pass for relevant content, or just before the Collection is ready to be published. </p>\r\n        <p>You have two options when sharing a Collection:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Share an entire Collection: This option requires anyone receiving the content to have a Pearson profile. </li>\r\n            <li>Share only the cover and Table of Contents: This options requires anyone receiving the files have an email address. Only print Collections have this option.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Publishing a shared Collection publishes it for all users and prevents subsequent changes. So if you are sharing a Collection to garner feedback, do so before you publish it.</p>\r\n        <p>To share a Collection: </p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Select the share option you'd like to use. </li>\r\n            <li>Enter the email addresses of the people with whom you want to share the Collection in field provided. Use a semicolon to separate multiple addresses.</li>\r\n            <li>(Optional) Enter any notes or a message you want to include, and click <strong>Share</strong>.</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n        <p>To stop sharing a Collection with an individual, select the x next to the email address of that person.</p>"
