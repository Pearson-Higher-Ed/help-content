        <p>Pearson Collections imposes no specific work flow on when to share a Collection. You can share it after you initially create it, after you make a pass for relevant content, or just before the Collection is ready to be published. </p>
        <p>You have two options when sharing a Collection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Share an entire Collection: This option requires anyone receiving the content to have a Pearson profile. </li>
            <li>Share only the cover and Table of Contents: This option requires anyone receiving the files have an email address. Only print Collections have this option.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Publishing a shared Collection publishes it for all users and prevents subsequent changes. So if you are sharing a Collection to garner feedback, do so before you publish it.</p>
        <p>To share a Collection: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the share option you&apos;d like to use. </li>
            <li>Enter the email address of the person with whom you want to share the Collection in field provided. Be sure to press <strong>Enter</strong> to complete your entry.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Enter any notes or a message you want to include, and click <strong>Share</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To share the Collection with multiple people, repeat step 2, entering each email address one at a time. Be sure to press <strong>Enter</strong> to complete your entry.</p>
        <p>To stop sharing a Collection with an individual, select the x next to the email address of that person.</p></div></div>
