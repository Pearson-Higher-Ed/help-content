Filters appear across the top of the search results and include books, chapters, cases, and readings. When you select one of these filters, additional filters appear on the left side of the screen. For example, when you filter by Books or Chapters, you see discipline and subdiscipline filters on the left.</p>\r\n        <p> Selecting the Cases filter displays the Publisher, Industry, and Page Length filters </p>\r\n        <p>Selecting the Reading filter shows Program Component, Theme, and Page Length filters.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>To filter search results</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>Select the content type you want to display in the results. </li>\r\n            <li>Select the discipline filter you want to use. </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n        <p>For example, to see only chapters, select <strong>Chapters</strong> as the content type filter.
